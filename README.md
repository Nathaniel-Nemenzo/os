## Goals
0. Write an operating system in Rust from scratch
1. Run Doom on the operating system
2. Run the operating system on a Raspberry Pi

## Tenets
0. Build everything from scratch
   - Well ... maybe not *everything* (we'll run with an off-the-shelf bootloader for now), everything os-related is free game though
2. Test driven development
3. Clean code 

## What I Expect to Learn
0. Rust
1. Operating systems
