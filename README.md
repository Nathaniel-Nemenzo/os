## Goals
0. Write an operating system in Rust from scratch
1. Run Doom on the operating system
2. Run the operating systems on a Raspberry Pi

## Tenets
0. Build everything from scratch
   - Well ... maybe not *everything* (we'll run with an off-the-shelf bootloader for now), everything os-related is free game though
2. Test driven development
3. Clean code 

## What I Expect to Learn
0. Vim motions (I will aim to primarily use Vim on this project)
1. Obviously Rust
2. Obviously operating systems
